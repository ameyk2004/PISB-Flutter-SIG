# PISB Flutter SIG - Medicine Finder App ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the official repository for the PISB Flutter SIG! This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to Flutter development, where participants build a practical Medicine Finder App from scratch.

The app allows users to:

- **Search for Medicines**: Enter a medicine name and fetch detailed information like usage, side effects, dosage, and pricing using external APIs.
- **User Authentication**: Implement a basic login and logout system.
- **Interactive UI**: Learn Flutter widgets, navigation, state management, and Material Design principles.
  This repository contains:

- Step-by-step Code: Designed for beginners, with modular components for easy understanding.
- API Integration: Uses free APIs (OpenFDA) to demonstrate real-world data fetching.
- Documentation: Includes guidance for setting up the app and learning core Flutter concepts.
